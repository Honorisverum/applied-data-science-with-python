## Introduction
This repository aims to be a portfolio of my work during the 'Applied Data Science With Python' specialization held by the University of Michigan on Coursera. It also serves me as a quick reminder of some awesome tricks that I have used for data cleaning and analysis.

A big thank you to Professor Cristopher Brooks of the University of Michigan. Thanks for creating a data science specialization that guides the student to find his own tools for solving real data science problems!

The specialization consists of the following courses:
* Introduction to Data Science in Python
* Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
* Applied Machine Learning in Python
* Applied Text Mining in Python
* Applied Social Network Analysis in Python

For each course in part, I have condensed all the assignments in one major notebook for easier visualization.


### Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python
This course showed me how to take tabular data, clean it,  manipulate it, and run inferential statistical analyses on it. I had to complete three different assignments during this course. They were really awesome as it required a lot of individual learning which makes the learning more memorable for future tasks. Here is a basic description of each assignment completed:
* **Data Processing with Pandas and Numpy**

This assignment introduced data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduced the abstraction of the DataFrame as the central data structure for data analysis.
* **Advanced Pandas usage**

In this assignment I was asked to use pandas to answer more difficult questions. I definitely feel that I have learned a lot on this assignment as I had to search and investigate a lot of issues on StackOverflow. This made my knowledge of this library stronger as I had spent quite a few time analysing its different functions.
* **Statistical analysis in Python - hypothesis testing**

In this assignment I was asked to conduct a hypothesis testing using three different datasets. It gave me a glimpse on how I could run inferential statistical analyses.

### Course 2: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
This course introduced me to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course started with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. It also introduced me to the best practices when creating new charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework.

To pass this course, I had to complete 3 assignments. Here is a short description of each assignment in part:
* **Plotting Weather Patterns**

In this assignment, I worked with real world CSV weather data. I had to manipulate the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate that I know how to create a line graph using matplotlib. Additionally, I overlayed a scatter plot of record breaking data for a particular year.

* **Building a custom visualization**

For this assignment I had to implement a visualization of sample data as described in Ferreria et al. (2014). I had implemented the bar coloring as described in the paper, where the color of the bar is actually based on the amount of data covered (a gradient ranging from dark blue for the distribution being certainly below this y-axis, to white if the value is certainly contained, to dark red if the value is certainly not contained as the distribution is above the axis). I chose the 'Even Harder' option in which I had to make the plot interactive, allowing the user to click on the y axis to set the value of interest. The bar colors change with respect to what value the user has selected.

* **Becoming an independent data scientist**

This assignment required to identify at least two publicly accessible datasets that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. I had to state a research question that can be answered using these datasets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses the stated research question. I also had to justify how the visual addresses my research question. As this assignment was for the whole course, I had to incorporate and defend the principles discussed in the first week and align with Cairoâ€™s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight.
